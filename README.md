# JVM Concurrency

Examples for my "JVM Concurrency Models" talk.

They are in a half-finished state, and I wanted to add a benchmark, too, so you might want to come back some time later. Anyway, don't take the examples too seriously, they are not a great work of engineering.

If you're intested in the slides for the talk:
